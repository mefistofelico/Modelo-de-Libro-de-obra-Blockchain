This is an application that replicates the functionality of the Site Book used in the field of construction. It is inspired by the Blockchain methodology to encrypt and capture the pages that describe the evolution of civil works.

How to use it:

On the main page there are two links that redirect both to the resident engineer section and to the inspector engineer section. In both there will be a button with the text "REGISTRARSE" that will display a registration form. In case it is the first time that the entry “CONTRASEÑA” and “CONFIRMACION” is entered, it must contain the same characters, and in case you want to change the username or password, you must enter the new data but making sure to enter in the “CONFIRMACION” box. ” the antecedent password

In the upper box you must enter the username and password registered in the previous step to validate your identity, after this you can select the document to register and send it.

If both engineers enter the document and they present the same hash, the application will automatically record the Date, the hash and a receipt that will help validate the authenticity of the recorded record, otherwise, the application will not record the information and will wait for consensus between both engineers

Consideration:

-The application is oriented to store documents in pdf formats. Although it is not exclusive for some other format, it is pertinent to clarify that the name of the document will end with the character .pdf
